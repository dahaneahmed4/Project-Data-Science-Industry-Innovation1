* **Interactive Visualizations:**
    * Simulated "Live Data Ingestion" stream in the Hero section.
    * Auto-highlighting Sidebar Navigation based on scroll position.
* **Deep Technical Detail:** Includes Python code snippets (TensorFlow, NetworkX) and mathematical context.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that adapts from desktop ultra-wide monitors to mobile phones.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
Since this project uses **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**, no build tools (React, Vue, npm) are required.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Run Locally:**
    Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

## 🎨 Customization
The site uses **CSS Variables** for easy theming. You can change the entire color palette by editing the `:root` section in the `<style>` tag:

```css
:root {
    --bg-app: #05060a;        /* Main Background */
    --primary-blue: #A8C7FA;  /* Headers */
    --accent-cyan: #64ffda;   /* Neon Accents */
